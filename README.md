## üéØ What You'll Learn

This series takes you from basic concepts to advanced implementations of AI agents:

- Basic agent architectures and decision-making
- Environment design and interaction
- Multi-agent systems and communication
- Advanced frameworks (LangChain, AutoGPT, etc.)
- Real-world applications and case studies
